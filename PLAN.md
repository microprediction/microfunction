Steps... pulling apart the following: 

### Utilities

 - Implement [microboards](https://github.com/microprediction/microboards) utilities for exposing tables & leaderboards nicely using some of the front end code at [microprediction-site](https://github.com/EricZLou/microprediction-site)
 - Implement [lottery](https://github.com/microprediction/lottery) where rolling lottery-like mechanisms are implemented. Thus far categorical lottery is there. Nearest the pin to come.
