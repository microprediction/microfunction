Overall goal is the creation of a template micromanager that others can easily modify

### Permissions

 - Use [muid](https://github.com/microprediction/muid) as is. 

### Eyeballs

 - Implement [microboards](https://github.com/microprediction/microboards) utilities for exposing tables & leaderboards nicely using some of the front end code at [microprediction-site](https://github.com/EricZLou/microprediction-site)

### Calculations & scoring conventions 

 - Separately implement rolling [lottery](https://github.com/microprediction/lottery) calculations to avoid crude elsewhere. 

### Endpoint deployment

 - Most likely integrate with [functions-framework-python](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/functions-framework-python) and create the template in [microfunction](https://github.com/microprediction/microfunction) with utilities in [microfunctions](https://github.com/microprediction/microfunctions) 

### Navigation

 - Create [microregistry](https://github.com/microprediction/microregistry) to abstract away most of the navigation crud.
